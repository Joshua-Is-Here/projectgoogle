    <p class="presentation">Hello, my name is Joshua Oviedo Tinoco, I created this website because my goal was to learn how to create a selling digital store from scratch without having to depend too much on JavaScript. This website was created with 90% of HTML and CSS.</p>
    <div class="presentation2">
        <p>The main idea of this project was to make things function! For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When you click on the 'Buy Now' buttom, it will redirect you to a next page that let's you know that your purchased has been completed.</li>
        <li>When you go to the 'Contact Me' section, you'll be able to sent a message to me!</li>
        <li>When you go to 'Calculator,' you can use a calculator on a website.</li>
    </ul>
